Most devlopers cannot think like attackers.  
Developers not learn from others' mistakes.  
Customers can't evaluate software security.  
Security always not considered seriously.  

## We must

1. IDENTITY: assess management  
2. PROTECT: data security, access control, awareness and training  
3. DETECT: monitoring  
4. RESPOND: ensure adequate response  
5. RECOVER: recovery planning and improvement
